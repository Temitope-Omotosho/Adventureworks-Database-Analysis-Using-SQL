# Adventureworks-Database-Analysis-Using-SQL

This project aims to put to practice my SQL skills by analyzing the Adventureworks database. I will be working on 16 tasks to be solved using SQL queries. 
The Adventureworks database was used in this analysis and the Entity Relationship Diagram shown below was what guided the analysis to know where the required data are. The database contains 6 schemas including;
- Product
- Purchasing
- Human Resource
- Sales
- Person
- Dbo.
